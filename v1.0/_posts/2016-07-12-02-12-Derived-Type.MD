RESTier supports derived type starting from version 0.6.

Derived type support does not need any additional configuration, it is supported by default. 

Refer to method CURDDerivedEntity in class [TrippinE2ETestCases](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/blob/master/test/ODataEndToEnd/Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Tests/TrippinE2ETestCases.cs) and method DerivedTypeQuery in class [TrippinE2EQueryTestCases](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/blob/master/test/ODataEndToEnd/Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Tests/TrippinE2EQueryTestCases.cs) to see the end to end example.


Note: In a typical IIS configuration, the dot in this URL will cause IIS to return error 404. You can resolve this by adding the following section to your Web.Config file:

	<system.webServer>
	    <handlers>
	      <clear/>
	      <add name="ExtensionlessUrlHandler-Integrated-4.0" path="/*" 
	          verb="*" type="System.Web.Handlers.TransferRequestHandler" 
	          preCondition="integratedMode,runtimeVersionv4.0" />
	    </handlers>
	</system.webServer>
