If you want to debug **OData Lib, WebAPI, Restier** source, open `DEBUG` -> `Options and Settings` in VS, configure below things in `General` tab:

1. Uncheck `Enable Just My Code (Managed only)`.
2. Uncheck `Enable .NET Framework source stepping`.
3. UnCheck `Require source files to exactly match the original version`.
4. Check `Enable source server support`.

Setup your symbol source in `Symbols` tab:

1. Check `Microsoft Symbol Servers`.
2. Add location: http://srv.symbolsource.org/pdb/Public (For preview/public releases in nuget.org).
3. Add location: http://srv.symbolsource.org/pdb/MyGet (For nightly build, and preview releases in myget.org).
4. Set the cache symbols directory in your, the path should be as short as it can be.

Turn on the CLR first change exception to do a quick debug, open `DEBUG` -> `Exceptions` in VS, check the `Common Language Runtime Exceptions`.

RESTier also exposes a configuration which will return the whole exception stack trace if there is any exception thrown on the server side for the request, it is disabled by default, it can be enabled via call "***config.SetUseVerboseErrors(true);***" during routes register.
