description: ""
category: "6. Announcements"
---

This is the first GA release of RESTier, it is based on newest [odata .net library 7.x](http://odata.github.io/odata.net/v7/) and newest [Web API OData library 6.x](http://odata.github.io/WebApi/). 

Now it is more flexibility for user to define the behavior, and lots more customization capability as both ODL and WAO have adopted Dependency Injection. All the service registered in DI container by ODL and WAO can be customized. Refer to ODL and WAO documents for more detail.

**Three breaking changes impacts any consumer who implements its own API are,**

1. Must create a constructor which accept a IServiceProvider, the IServiceProvider will be set automatically when Api instance is retrieved from DI container.

2. ConfigureApi method is static and has one additional parameter "Type apiType", and in this method, it must call ApiBase or EntityFrameworkApi<T> ConfigureApi method to have Api registered as DI service.

3. Starting 1.0 release, there are more smaller granularity control on the properties which can be used in query option, and all properties are disabled to be used by default. User can add configured in CLR class or during model build to configure which properties are allowed to be used in filter/expand/select/orderby/count. Refer to **[Model bound](http://odata.github.io/WebApi/#13-01-modelbound-attribute)** document for more details. User can also use configuration "config.Filter().Expand().Select().OrderBy().MaxTop(null).Count();" to enable filter/expand/select/orderby/count on all properties.

**New features since 0.6.0**

 - Add resource attribute for the properties in Api class
	 - Now for the properties in API class, it must have Resource attribute to be built as entity set or singleton.
 - Make URI resolver as DI service.
	 - URL resolver will need to be registered as DI service which was set via config before.
 - Move ApiBase as DI service and remove ApiContext.
	 - ApiBase is DI service now and one instance is created for each request. Remove ApiContext to make logic clear. 
 - Make ApiConfiguration as internal service.
	 - ApiConfiguration is moved as internal service now, if additional static configuration is needed for Api class, a DI singleton service is recommeded.
 - Use WepApi OData formatting attribute and remove RESTier formatting attribute.
