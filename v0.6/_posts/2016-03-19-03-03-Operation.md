Operation includes function (bounded), function import (unbounded), action (bounded), and action(unbounded). 

To supports operation, there are two major items, first being able to build model for operation, refer to [section 2.5](http://odata.github.io/RESTier/#02-05-Model-building-0-5-0) for more details. Second support to route operation requests to a controller action.

Starting from release 0.6.0, RESTier can auto route an operation request to the method defined in API class which is defined for operation model building, user does **NOT** need to define its own controller with ODataRoute attribute for operation route.

Refer to [end to end test cases](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/blob/master/test/ODataEndToEnd/Microsoft.OData.Service.Sample.Tests/UrlConventionsTests.cs) for end to end operation support samples.

Note: In a typical IIS configuration, the dot in this URL will cause IIS to return error 404. You can resolve this by adding the following section to your Web.Config file:

	<system.webServer>
	    <handlers>
	      <clear/>
	      <add name="ExtensionlessUrlHandler-Integrated-4.0" path="/*" 
	          verb="*" type="System.Web.Handlers.TransferRequestHandler" 
	          preCondition="integratedMode,runtimeVersionv4.0" />
	    </handlers>
	</system.webServer>
