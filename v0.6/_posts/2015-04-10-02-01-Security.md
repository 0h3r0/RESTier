**Authentication and Authorization (>=0.4.0)**

REStier is transparent to security now, any security configurations / methodology working for Web APi will work for RESTier. 

One item is special in RESTier, there is only one controller named RESTier controller, and user can implement other additional controllers which extends ODataController class, in order to have consistent authentication for all these controllers, user need to configure Authentication and Authorization filter at global level.

Restier also provides capability to inspect each request, refer section [2.8](http://odata.github.io/RESTier/#02-08-Customize-Query) and [2.9](http://odata.github.io/RESTier/#02-09-Customize-Submit) for more details.
 
For Web Api security, refer to [Web Api Security document](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/security).

Note: Restier uses asynchronous call to the provider layer (entity framework), this means by default the principal used to logic the application will not passed to call to provider, if the application need to pass principal from application to provider layer, refer to this [link](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/tom/2008/04/22/making-an-asynchronous-call-using-the-impersonation-identity/) on the detail configuration.
