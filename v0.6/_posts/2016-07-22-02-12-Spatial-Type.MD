RESTier supports spatial type starting from version 0.6 with some manual effort.

There are two ways to support spatial type, refer to the end to end samples for more detail.

[SpatialSample](https://github.com/OData/ODataSamples/tree/master/RESTier/SpatialSample) will need few manual effort to build model, but there is one limitation that user can not have the spatial type property in query option.

[SpatialSample2](https://github.com/OData/ODataSamples/tree/master/RESTier/SpatialSample2) will require to use Edm model builder to build model, have full support of spatial type.
