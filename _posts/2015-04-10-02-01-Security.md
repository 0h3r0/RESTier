**Authentication (>=0.4.0)**

REStier is transparent to security now, any security configurations / methodology working for Web APi will work for RESTier. 


**RESTier Role Based Security [0.4.0-beta only]**

Currently the quality of the RESTier role-based security module is **NOT** guaranteed and this module will **NOT** be shipped with regular RESTier releases and will not be part of first GA release. Please use it at your own risk.

For example code, please refer to [NorthwindApi](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/blob/master/test/ODataEndToEndTests/Microsoft.Restier.Samples.Northwind/Models/NorthwindApi.cs#L22-L32).
